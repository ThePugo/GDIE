When I get home

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.500 line:0
You better not be there

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.500 line:0
We're placin' bets you won't

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.700 line:0
Shed your modesty

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.400 line:0
And the only thing to leave behind

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.000 line:0
Is your own skin on the floor

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.000 line:0
Don't you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.700 line:0
Manifest a ceiling

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.100 line:0
When you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.500 line:0
Searchin' for that feelin'

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.500 line:0
Just like an "I love you" (Ooh, ooh)

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.400 line:0
That isn't words (Ooh, ooh)

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.700 line:0
Like a song he wrote, that's
never heard (Ah-ah-ah)

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.400 line:0
Don't you sh…

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.900 line:0
When you get home

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.800 line:0
You barely recognize the pictures

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.000 line:0
They put in a frame

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.600 line:0
'Cause you shed your modеsty

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.700 line:0
Don't circle the track

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.200 line:0
Take what you havе

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.450 line:0
And leave your skin on the floor

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.300 line:0
Don't you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.000 line:0
Manifest a ceiling

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.900 line:0
When you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.900 line:0
Searchin' for that feelin'

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000 line:0
Just like an "I love you" (Ooh, ooh)

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.300 line:0
That isn't words (Ooh, ooh)

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.500 line:0
Like a song he wrote (Ah-ah-ah)

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.200 line:0
That's never heard

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.800 line:0
When I get home

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.100 line:0
Boy, you better not be there

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.000 line:0
You're long gone

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.600 line:0
Shed your modesty

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.200 line:0
Don't circle the track

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.800 line:0
Just break the cycle in half

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.900 line:0
And leave your skin on the floor

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.400 line:0
Don't you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.000 line:0
Manifest a ceiling

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.800 line:0
When you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.100 line:0
Searchin' for that feelin'

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.000 line:0
Just like an "I love you" (Ooh, ooh)

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.600 line:0
That isn't words (Ooh, ooh)

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.500 line:0
Like a song he wrote (Ah-ah-ah)

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.200 line:0
That's never heard

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.300 line:0
That's never heard (Ah-
ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.500 line:0
An "I love you"

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.900 line:0
That isn't words

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.150 line:0
Like a song he wrote

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.900 line:0
That's never heard

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.400 line:0
Don't you shy away
