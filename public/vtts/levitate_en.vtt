00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.500 line:0
Oh, I know how to levitate
up off my feet

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.800 line:0
And ever since the seventh grade
I learned to fire-breathe

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.050 line:0
And though I feed on things that fell

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.800 line:0
You can learn to levitate
with just a little help

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.900 line:0
Learn to levitate with
just a little help

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000 line:0
Come down, come down

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.900 line:0
Cowards only come through
when the hour's late

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.700 line:0
And everyone's asleep, mind you

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.100 line:0
Now show up, show up

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.300 line:0
I know I shouldn't say this

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.100 line:0
But a curse from you is all that
I would need right now, man

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.300 line:0
Come down, come down

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.200 line:0
Cowards only come through
when the hour's late

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.900 line:0
And everyone's asleep, mind you

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.600 line:0
Now show up, show up

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.600 line:0
I know I shouldn't say this

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.500 line:0
But a curse from you is all that
I would need right now, man

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.900 line:0
Danger in the fabric of
this thing I made

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.200 line:0
I probably shouldn't show you,
but it's way too late

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.000 line:0
My heart is with you hiding,
but my mind's not made

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.400 line:0
Now they know it like we both
knew for some time I'd say

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.500 line:0
They're smirking at first blood,
they're circling above

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.700 line:0
But this is not enough

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.200 line:0
Yeah, this is not what you thought

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.500 line:0
No, no we are not just graffiti
on a passing train

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.600 line:0
I got back what I once bought back

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.000 line:0
In that slot I won't need to replace

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.600 line:0
This culture is a poacher of
overexposure, not today

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.600 line:0
Don't feed me to the vultures

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.500 line:0
I am a vulture who feeds on pain

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.900 line:0
Sleep in a well-lit room, don't
let the shadow through

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.100 line:0
And sever all I knew, yeah, sever all

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.000 line:0
I thought I could depend
on my weekends

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.200 line:0
On the freezing ground
that I'm sleeping on

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.700 line:0
Please, keep me from, please,
keep me down from the ledges

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.800 line:0
Better test it, wooden
wedges under doorways

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.400 line:0
Keep your wooden wedges under doors

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.000 line:0
Chorus, verse, chorus, verse

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.900 line:0
Now here comes the eight

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000 line:0
Wait, habits here too

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.500 line:0
You're the worst, your
structure compensates

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.800 line:0
But compensation feels a lot like rising
up to dominate by track two

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.700 line:0
At least they all know all they
hear comes from a place

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.100 line:0
Oh, I know how to levitate
up off my feet

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.300 line:0
And ever since the seventh grade
I learned to fire-breathe

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.600 line:0
