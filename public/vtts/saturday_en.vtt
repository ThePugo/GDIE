Slow down on Monday

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.100 line:0
Not a sound on Wednesday, yeah

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.100 line:0
Might get loud (Ayy) on Friday

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.300 line:0
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.300 line:0
We paint the town

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.800 line:0
Lose my sense a time or two

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.300 line:0
Weeks feel like days

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.400 line:0
Medicate in the afternoon

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.400 line:0
And I just want to know;

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.200 line:0
Have you lost your footing, too?

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.900 line:0
I just pray that I'm not losing you

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.200 line:0
Catch me floatin' circles
in my fishbowl

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.900 line:0
Keep things fresh

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.700 line:0
She said that I should
change my clothes

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.200 line:0
I exaggerate the life we
used to know, oh, oh

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.200 line:0
Slow down on Monday

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.100 line:0
Not a sound on Wednesday, yeah

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.300 line:0
Might get loud (Ayy) on Friday

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.200 line:0
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.100 line:0
We paint the town

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.300 line:0
Ooh, you're good

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.000 line:0
These are my dancin' shoes

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.900 line:0
We paint the town

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.400 line:0
Ooh, you're good

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.900 line:0
Thought I would dance with you

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.100 line:0
Might get loud (Ayy) on Friday

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.000 line:0
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.850 line:0
We paint the town

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.200 line:0
(Feelin' great)

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.800 line:0
Life moves slow on the ocean floor

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.200 line:0
(Feelin' great)

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.400 line:0
I can't feel the waves anymore

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.000 line:0
Did the tide forget to move?

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.100 line:0
I just pray that I'm not losin' you

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.100 line:0
Catch me floatin' circles
in my fishbowl

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.800 line:0
Keep things fresh

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.400 line:0
She said that I should
change my clothes

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.200 line:0
I exaggerate the life we
used to know, oh, yeah

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.500 line:0
Working on music?

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.300 line:0
Yeah

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.400 line:0
I-I'll just go to bed, I'm tired

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.100 line:0
I wanna watch 'Friends' with you

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.000 line:0
Oh, if you feel like you have
time to do a song or you're inspired

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.800 line:0
You should just go for it (Oh)

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.000 line:0
(Oh) Slow down on Monday (Yeah, yeah)

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.100 line:0
Not a sound on Wednesday

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.300 line:0
Might get loud (Ayy) on Friday
