00:00:01.876 --> 00:00:03.461 line:0
I am trapped.

00:00:03.962 --> 00:00:06.715 line:0
Stuck in a cycle I have never
been able to break.

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:09.843 line:0
I want to believe this
is the last time, but

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:13.054 line:0
I don't know for sure.

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.683 line:0
I'll start with what I do know.

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:19.602 line:0
I am a citizen of an old city.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.398 line:0
Well, they say it's old, but
there's just no proof.

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:27.110 line:0
I can feel my friends
rolling their eyes.

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.487 line:0
I'll keep it simple.

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:31.197 line:0
I am a citizen of Dema,

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:33.950 line:0
a circular cement city
in the lower portion

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:37.620 line:0
of an otherwise wild and green
continent, Trench.

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:39.664 line:0
We aren't allowed to go out there.

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:43.376 line:0
Most haven't even seen it. But I have.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:45.378 line:0
I am an escapee.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.006 line:0
Getting better at it
with every attempt.

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:50.425 line:0
But they always find me.

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:52.802 line:0
Well, he does.

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:54.220 line:0
Nico.

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:57.098 line:0
Or, Blurryface is what
he calls himself.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.601 line:0
He's the leader of the nine Bishops

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:00.977 line:0
who govern the city.

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:03.438 line:0
Their authority comes from two things:

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:07.192 line:0
a miraculous power and
a hijacked religion.

00:01:07.358 --> 00:01:09.235 line:0
One feeds the other.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:11.321 line:0
A cycle.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.073 line:0
It's called Vialism.

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:14.816 line:0
And all you really need to know

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.326 line:0
is that it teaches that
self-destruction

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:18.828 line:0
is the only way to paradise.

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:20.864 line:0
It also conveniently allows you

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:24.793 line:0
to become an available vessel
for the Bishops to use.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:28.338 line:0
And that's where the miracle comes in.

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:30.465 line:0
We call it seizing.

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:31.416 line:0
The rules are

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.427 line:0
that you can only seize,
or control, a dead body

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.638 line:0
and only for a short while.

00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:38.681 line:0
Also, they, the Bishops,

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:41.226 line:0
are the only ones who can do it.

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:42.977 line:0
I am a citizen.

00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:45.188 line:0
I am an escapee.

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:49.442 line:0
And I am an exception to the rule.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.903 line:0
Okay, this is what happened recently.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.740 line:0
I tricked Nico into taking
me outside the walls.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.994 line:0
I created a fiery diversion.

00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:01.830 line:0
I escaped.

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.209 line:0
I wandered,

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:08.661 line:0
grew weak,

00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:10.130 line:0
and was tracked down.

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.590 line:0
But this drag path was different.

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:17.637 line:0
I saw them. They watched
me. The Banditos.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.474 line:0
Legends, only stories of a group
that lived out here.

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.935 line:0
Shortly after being back
inside the walls

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:26.354 line:0
my new people got me out.

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:28.648 line:0
They needed me for something.

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:33.987 line:0
They brought me in, taught
me their colors.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.698 line:0
But the cycle was too strong.

00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:40.076 line:0
I was recaptured. Back inside.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:45.081 line:0
I guess word got around,
I became known in Dema.

00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:47.041 line:0
The Bishops did not like this,

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:49.711 line:0
but decided to use it
to their advantage.

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:52.797 line:0
They made me entertain the people.

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:54.382 line:0
Lie to them.

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.051 line:0
They made me perform for them.

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:04.225 line:0
Then Nico was betrayed.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.361 line:0
And I escaped.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.571 line:0
Again.

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:17.730 line:0
This time

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.951 line:0
I found myself at a new place,
washed up on an island.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.081 line:0
And there, I was given a gift,

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.958 line:0
thought to be extinct.

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:32.579 line:0
I now had the same exact,
miraculous power

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.631 line:0
they wielded from their towers.

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:39.344 line:0
I am a citizen.

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:42.722 line:0
I am an escapee.

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.476 line:0
I am an exception.

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:53.566 line:0
I am returning to Trench.
