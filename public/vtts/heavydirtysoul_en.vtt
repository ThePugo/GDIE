00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.100 line:0
There's an infestation in my mind's imagination

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.300 line:0
I hope they choke on smoke cause
I'm smoking them out the basement

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.900 line:0
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.700 line:0
Just another attempt to make the voices stop

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.400 line:0
Rapping to prove nothing,
just writing to say something

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.400 line:0
'Cause I wasn't the only one
who wasn't rushing to say nothing

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.100 line:0
This doesn't mean I lost my dream

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.400 line:0
It's just right now I got
a really crazy mind to clean

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.300 line:0
Gangsters don't cry

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.600 line:0
Therefore, therefore I'm

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.000 line:0
Mr. Misty-eye, therefore I'm

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.500 line:0
Can you save

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.400 line:0
Can you save my

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.100 line:0
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.900 line:0
Can you save

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.800 line:0

Can you save my heavy dirty soul?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.200 line:0
For me, for me, oh

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.300 line:0
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.800 line:0
For me, for me, oh

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.900 line:0
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.300 line:0
No, I didn't understand the thing you said

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.100 line:0
If I didn't know better, I
guess you're all already dead

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.000 line:0
Mindless zombies walking
around with a limp and a hunch

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.000 line:0
Saying stuff like, "You only live once"

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.700 line:0
You got one time to figure it out

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.500 line:0
One time to twist and one time to shout

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.200 line:0
One time to think and I say we start now

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.300 line:0
Sing with me if you know what I'm talking about

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.600 line:0
Gangsters don't cry

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.900 line:0
Therefore, therefore I'm

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.200 line:0
Mr. Misty-eye, therefore I'm

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.000 line:0

Can you save my

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.400 line:0
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.700 line:0
For me, for me, oh

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.700 line:0
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.000 line:0
For me, for me, oh

Can you save my heavy dirty soul?

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.300 line:0
Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.400 line:0
Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit
